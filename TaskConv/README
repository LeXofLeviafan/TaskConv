TaskConvertor converts tasks with group tests from known formats in DL test format.


USAGE:
taskconv -h|--help
taskconv [-v|--verbose] [-m|--move] [-t TaskType|--type=TaskType] [-o OutFile|-output=OutFile]
         [-n TaskName|--name=TaskName] -d TaskDir|--directory=TaskDir|TaskDir

Options with arguments can be written in following ways:
 -d TaskDir
 -dTaskDir
 --directory=TaskDir
 --directory TaskDir
Also you can shorten long options (like "--dir Outfile"), up to one letter long ("--v").

TaskType can be shortened, too - just try to not make it ambiguous (if it is, the program
will make a guess based on possible variants).


Files contained in "DB/" directory are known types. Feel free to add your own (make sure to do it
the right way though). Format is following:

1st line = input filename pattern
2nd line = output filename pattern
Both patterns use '/' character as directory separator.

pattern details:
	${varname} - variable
	$[varname] - variable may be omitted (SS or SL only)
the variables are:
	TaskName - the name of the task
	S - testgroup number
	SS - test number in group
	SL - test letter in group (Alphabet[SS])

TaskName is the only variable that has nothing to do with test structure itself.
If the program fails to detect it for some reason, you may set it with "-n" option.


File ".cfg" contains characters for path validations:
	First line contains valid characters for TaskName.
